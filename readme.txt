hjkl shooter

Here is a training game for vi's movement keys.

You are the spaceship in the middle. You can move around using the hjkl keys. To attack the trolls, you go into editing mode with the "a", "i" or "r" key. While in editing mode, you type in the text below (example "Hello World". This game is case sensitive) You can go back into movement mode with the escape key.

To exit, press alt+F4

Not implemented: a life and scoring system. When you are touched by a troll, your life should go down.
